Bootstrap 

    DISCO:

    The syntax for Bootstrap is very similar to Tailwind. To style an element, you declare the class name in the html along with what you what to style in the quotations.

  Foundation 

    DISCO:

    The 12-column grid system allowed for easy layout adjustments, while pre-styled components like buttons and modals saved time. The built-in JavaScript plugins, such as the off-canvas menu, added interactivity     
    with minimal effort.

    I prefer Tailwind over Foundation because I think that the features are simple to implement and they vary a lot more than those of Foundation. Foundation seems to have a lot of good organizational features, but I like how easy it is to make things look cooler with Tailwind.
